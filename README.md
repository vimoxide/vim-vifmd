> This plugin is based on 'skywind3000/vim-terminal-help', i'm still experimenting with vifm as file drawer but so far it's promising, aside from a couple of hiccups

### Caveats

1. In vim, there might be a slight flicker upon selecting a file
2. In neovim, there's no flicker but a light delay
3. Opening multiple files is busted ftm but i know how to fix it
